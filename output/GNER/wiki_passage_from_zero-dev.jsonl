The core assumption of [[BrownBoost]] is that noisy examples will be repeatedly mislabeled by the weak hypotheses and non-noisy examples will be correctly labeled frequently enough to not be \"given up on.\" Thus only noisy examples will be \"given up on,\" whereas non-noisy examples will contribute to the final classifier.

If a convex loss is utilized (as in [[AdaBoost]] or [[LogitBoost]], for instance) then a sample with a higher margin will receive less (or equal) weight than a sample with a lower margin. This leads the boosting algorithm to focus weight on low-margin samples.

NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADP<sup>+</sup> are [[cofactor]]s in a wide variety of enzymatic [[oxidation-reduction]] reactions, most notably [[glycolysis]], the [[citric acid cycle]], and the [[electron transport chain]]. If humans ingest nicotinamide, it will likely undergo a series of reactions that transform it into NAD, which can then undergo a transformation to form NADP<sup>+</sup>.
