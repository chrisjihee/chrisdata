An anonymous 1859 review in [[The Athenaeum]] praised it as a \"novel of the highest class,\" and [[The Times]] called it \"a first-rate novel.\" An anonymous review by [[Anne Mozley]] was the first to speculate that the novel was probably written by a woman. Contemporary reviewers, often influenced by nostalgia for the earlier period represented in Bede, enthusiastically praised Eliot's characterisations and realistic representations of rural life. [[Charles Dickens]] wrote: \"The whole country life that the story is set in, is so real, and so droll and genuine, and yet so selected and polished by art, that I cannot praise it enough to you.\" (Hunter, S. 122)", "The importance of [[William Wordsworth]]'s [[Lyrical Ballads]] to the way [[Adam Bede]] is written has often been noted. Like Wordsworth's poems, [[Adam Bede]] features minutely detailed empirical and psychological observations about illiterate \"common folk\" who, because of their greater proximity to nature than to culture, are taken as emblematic of human nature in its more pure form. In [[Adam Bede]], Eliot sought to manifest in novelistic form this principle of Wordsworth's aesthetic philosophy.", "[[Adam Bede]] was the [[first novel]] by English author [[George Eliot]], pen name of Mary Ann Evans, first published in 1859. It was published [[pseudonymously]], even though Evans was a well-published and highly respected scholar of her time.

As with [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Thomas Hardy]], she emerged from provincial England; most of her works are set there. Her works are known for their [[realism]], [[psychological insight]], sense of place and detailed depiction of the countryside. Middlemarch was described by the novelist [[Virginia Woolf]] as \"one of the few English novels written for grown-up people\" and by [[Martin Amis]] and [[Julian Barnes]] as the greatest novel in the English language.", "Throughout her career, Eliot wrote with a politically astute pen. From [[Adam Bede]] to [[The Mill on the Floss]] and [[Silas Marner]], Eliot presented the cases of social outsiders and small-town persecution. [[Felix Holt, the Radical]] and The Legend of Jubal were overtly political, and political crisis is at the heart of [[Middlemarch]], in which she presents the stories of a number of inhabitants of a small English town on the eve of the [[Reform Bill of 1832]]; the novel is notable for its deep psychological insight and sophisticated character portraits. The roots of her realist philosophy can be found in her review of [[John Ruskin]]'s [[Modern Painters]] in [[Westminster Review]] in 1856. Eliot also express proto-[[Zionist]] ideas in [[Daniel Deronda]].", "Eliot was profoundly influenced by the works of [[Thomas Carlyle]]. As early as 1841, she referred to him as \"a grand favourite of mine\", and references to him abound in her letters from the 1840s and 1850s. According to [[University of Victoria]] professor Lisa Surridge, Carlyle \"stimulated Eliot's interest in German thought, encouraged her turn from Christian orthodoxy, and shaped her ideas on work, duty, sympathy, and the evolution of the self.\" These themes made their way into Evans's first complete novel, [[Adam Bede]] (1859).", "The ampersand often appeared as a character at the end of the Latin alphabet, as for example in [[Byrhtferð's]] list of letters from 1011. Similarly, was regarded as the 27th letter of the [[English alphabet]], as taught to children in the US and elsewhere. An example may be seen in M. B. Moore's 1863 book The Dixie Primer, for the Little Folks. In her 1859 novel [[Adam Bede]], [[George Eliot]] refers to this when she makes Jacob Storey say: \"He thought it <nowiki>[Z]</nowiki> had only been put to finish off th' alphabet like; though ampusand would ha' done as well, for what he could see.\" The popular nursery rhyme [[Apple Pie ABC]] finishes with the lines \"X, Y, Z, and ampersand, All wished for a piece in hand\"."], "num_passages": 7, "source_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?fulltext=1&ns0=1&search=Adam+Bede"}

The epithets applied by Virgil are an example of an attitude different from that of Homer, for whilst Odysseus is (\"wily\"), [[Aeneas]] is described as (\"pious\"), which conveys a strong moral tone. The purpose of these epithets seems to enforce the notion of [[Aeneas]]' divine hand as father and founder of the Roman race, and their use seems circumstantial: when [[Aeneas]] is praying he refers to himself as pius, and is referred to as such by the author only when the character is acting on behalf of the gods to fulfill his divine mission.

McTell was also an adept [[slide guitar]]ist, unusual among ragtime bluesmen.

Another of his notable compositions is \"[[From Clare to Here]]\", a [[ballad]] about Irish emigration. In the 1980s, he wrote and played songs for two TV children's programmes, [[Alphabet Zoo]], which also featured [[Nerys Hughes]], followed by [[Tickle on the Tum]], featuring Jaqui Reddin.

[[[[DNA polymerase]] II]] was discovered by [[Thomas Kornberg]] (the son of [[Arthur Kornberg]]) and Malcolm E. Gefter in 1970 while further elucidating the role of Pol I in E. coli DNA replication.

From 1983 on, DNA polymerases have been used in the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), and from 1988 [[thermostable [[DNA polymerase]]]]s were used instead, as they do not need to be added in every cycle of a PCR.", "[[Telomerase]] is a [[ribonucleoprotein]] which functions to replicate ends of linear chromosomes since normal [[DNA polymerase]] cannot replicate the ends, or [[telomeres]]. The single-strand 3' overhang of the double-strand chromosome with the sequence 5'-TTAGGG-3' recruits telomerase. Telomerase acts like other DNA polymerases by extending the 3' end, but, unlike other DNA polymerases, telomerase does not require a template. The TERT subunit, an example of a [[reverse transcriptase]], uses the RNA subunit to form the primer–template junction that allows telomerase to extend the 3' end of chromosome ends. The gradual decrease in size of telomeres as the result of many replications over a lifetime are thought to be associated with the effects of aging.", "The main function of [[DNA polymerase]] is to synthesize DNA from [[deoxyribonucleotide]]s, the building blocks of DNA. The DNA copies are created by the pairing of nucleotides to bases present on each strand of the original DNA molecule. This pairing always occurs in specific combinations, with [[cytosine]] along with [[guanine]], and [[thymine]] along with [[adenine]], forming two separate pairs, respectively. By contrast, [[RNA polymerase]]s synthesize RNA from [[ribonucleotide]]s from either RNA or DNA.", "[[DNA polymerase I]] (or Pol I) is an [[enzyme]] that participates in the process of prokaryotic [[DNA replication]]. Discovered by [[Arthur Kornberg]] in 1956, it was the first known [[DNA polymerase]] (and the first known of any kind of [[polymerase]]). It was initially characterized in [[E. coli]] and is ubiquitous in [[prokaryote]]s. In E. coli and many other bacteria, the [[gene]] that encodes Pol I is known as polA. The E.&nbsp;coli Pol I enzyme is composed of 928 amino acids, and is an example of a [[processive]] enzyme — it can sequentially catalyze multiple polymerisation steps without releasing the single-stranded template. The physiological function of Pol I is mainly to support repair of damaged DNA, but it also contributes to connecting [[Okazaki fragments]] by deleting RNA primers and replacing the ribonucleotides with DNA.", "[[RNA polymerase]] is essential to life, and is found in all living [[organism]]s and many [[virus]]es. Depending on the organism, a [[RNA polymerase]] can be a [[protein complex]] (multi-subunit RNAP) or only consist of one subunit (single-subunit RNAP, ssRNAP), each representing an independent lineage. The former is found in [[bacteria]], [[archaea]], and [[eukaryote]]s alike, sharing a similar core structure and mechanism. The latter is found in [[phage]]s as well as eukaryotic [[chloroplast]]s and [[mitochondria]], and is related to modern [[DNA polymerase]]s. Eukaryotic and archaeal RNAPs have more subunits than bacterial ones do, and are controlled differently.", "Many viruses use a single-subunit DNA-dependent RNAP (ssRNAP) that is structurally and mechanistically related to the single-subunit RNAP of eukaryotic chloroplasts (RpoT) and mitochondria ([[POLRMT]]) and, more distantly, to [[DNA polymerase]]s and [[reverse transcriptase]]s. Perhaps the most widely studied such single-subunit RNAP is [[bacteriophage]] [[T7 [[RNA polymerase]]]]. ssRNAPs cannot proofread.", "RNAP accomplishes [[de novo synthesis]]. It is able to do this because specific interactions with the initiating nucleotide hold RNAP rigidly in place, facilitating chemical attack on the incoming nucleotide. Such specific interactions explain why RNAP prefers to start transcripts with ATP (followed by GTP, UTP, and then CTP). In contrast to [[DNA polymerase]], RNAP includes [[helicase]] activity, therefore no separate enzyme is needed to unwind DNA.", "[[DNA polymerase II]] (also known as DNA Pol II or Pol II) is a [[prokaryotic]] DNA-dependent [[DNA polymerase]] encoded by the PolB gene."], "num_passages": 8, "source_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?fulltext=1&ns0=1&search=DNA+polymerase"}
